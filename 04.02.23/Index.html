<p>Nav element represents a section of a page that links to other pages or to parts within the page.
It dosen't have to contain a list only,and this element includes the global attibutes only.</p>

<h1> &lt;h1&gt;Conceitos gerais &lt;&frasl;h1&gt;</h1>
<h2 id="variáveis">Varibles </h2>
<p>
Variable is a storage space for data information to use later in the code.
That information can be acceed and manipulated easier if it is on a separeted place.
We store information all the time in daily life  
For exemple when you write on a pice of paper your card password and put in your wallet to use when you need.
the same happens on Variables but instead write on a paper you write on a code.
password = 804020
However, HTML itself does not have a concept of varibles or data types,
if not used in conjuction with languages that comunicates with the server side.
 </p>
            <h2 id="data types">Data types</h2>
<p>
Declaring the data type is not always required, but make your code more readable.
But whats is that? It is just a specification of what type the information is,
like when you want to eat cake with your friend, cutting the cake in two parts
But you only have one spoon and you can't cut it in two, because it's a spoon and we already learn that it is no cutteble
Similarly happens on the data types, it is necessary to daclare the data type that the system kwons whether it is a number or a text
</p>
<h2 id="funtion">Funtion</h2>
<p>
A funtion is like when you have a to-do list full of tasks, such as do the dishes
1- Organize the dishes
2- take the sponge and put soup on top
3- turn on the water
4- wet the sponge 
5- scrub the sponge on the first item
6- drain the dirty with the water
7- put it to dry 
To resume all of that we just write do the dishes
The next task is walk with the dog, and we alredy know how to do this because the steps are storage in our system
So in our daily to-do list we only write the name to call the task, imagine have to write every day all stpes of a task, would be huge
A funtion works like that, it breaks down a complex task into smaller steps, to be more organized and readable, and easier to call in other time.
</p>  
<h2 id="conditions">Conditions</h2>
<p>
In the computer is not accepted a maybe, like when I ask my boyfriend if he want's to go to a bar then he answer me "maybe, I don't know"
The program and I would prefer an answer like "yes", "no" or "if it doesn't rain than we can go" this is called logical operators 
and are used to control the flow of a program making it more flexible.
            </p>
            <h2 id="loops">loops</h2>
 <p>
Loops make a comand run as many time as we tell it to.
It is like when we are addicted on a music and can't stop listening to it and play all over again and again.
